# ScatterWords

`ScatterWords` is a very simple Windows application that lets you scatter each line of a text file over a 2D blackboard. I wrote this C# disaster in a hurry 'cause I needed a quick tool to manually cluster some text data.

If you're not interested in the code, just check out the release section.

## Some details

All settings are almost self-explanatory, the only thing that is implicit in the interface is that you can drag text files into the window. Have fun.

## Known issues

Since everything is redrawn each time you drag a label object, big window sizes may result in some lag.
